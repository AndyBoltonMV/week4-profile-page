      <p>
        There are very few jobs that I haven't put my hand to since leaving
        school in 2004. I've been a Kitchen Fitter, Cleaner, F2F Salesperson,
        Sales Assistant, Healthcare Assistant, Warehouse Manager and an
        Operations Manager. Most of those jobs provided me with one thing, a
        disdain for Monday's (Healthcare Assistant being the outlier).
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm now a Coach helping people move into the Software Development
        Industry. Having come into this skill set the same way as my students,
        passing my experience on as both a professional and an ex-student has
        eliminated my hatred of Monday's. I never feel like I'm working, almost
        like I get to share my hobby with people every day.
